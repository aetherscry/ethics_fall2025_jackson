In this podcast, Hero Czarnik and I (Damien Jackson) talk about the significance memes have on the travel of information. We cover politics, Twitch, harassment, jokes about government corruption, brainrot, and more!

The article we had read for this podcast is linked [here](https://online.ucpress.edu/representations/article/168/1/1/203766/Meme-Aesthetics)

### Potential TW: We talk about Epstein briefly (so please be mindful if you are uncomfortable with the mention of the topics around his crimes)
