We're met with a simple question: **What are buying when you buy a digital copy of something?**

Digital purchases happen all the time. From music, to Netflix subscriptions, to art programs, digital purchases take a large part in many of our lives in today's age of technology. 

But what are we actually *getting*?

## Lets look at iTunes


In October of 2021, Trenise McTyere filed a legal case against Apple inc.[^1]

McTyere had alleged that Apple had been falsely representing their product, by adding a "Buy" button on the iTunes Store under content they later removed customer access to.[^2]

Customers had been rightly frustrated. The content they *paid for* had suddenly vanished from access. If you were to buy a physical CD, you wouldn't expect the store you bought it from to take it back from you. How is it fair for Apple to suddenly pull their content back?

Apple had filed motion to dismiss. But, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York found enough plausibility in the case to allow McTyere to take the to court. As of writing, there is no verdict (U.S. law and court systems move very slowly).

## How about streaming services?


A frequent complaint we see about streaming services is the seemingly abrupt way that content is removed from the platforms. Disney+, for example, has had multiple instances of "content purges" from their platform.[^3] Customers are hardly warned, if ever, when certain content will suddenly disappear or reappear from a subscription they're paying for.

Additionally, we see a lot of frustration in *regionally based* content. For example, on Netflix, some movies are available in the U.S. that you can't watch if you are in Canada. And some movies are available on that same service in Canada, that you can't watch if you are in the U.S.

> Note: You can always get around this with a VPN, but geo-based restrictions are still implimented in these services.

## "Just tell us what we're buying, DJ."


What we "purchase" when spending money to access a digital product can vary greatly. It can be reliant on the company, the platform, or even the country you're in. 

Generally speaking, we do not "own" the products we recieve a digital copy of. We are purchasing a "license" from the distributor to access or download a product. 

We do not "own" digital items in the same way we purchase physical ones. 

Typically, you make an account of some kind to interact with digital stores. **The product is then tied to the account you interact through.** Not necessarily *you,* the human being. 

> Note: This also can be complicated. Sometimes companies forbid users from "sharing accounts" (One person buys a product on an account they create, then give other people the username and password). Others may allow users to share among family. So, who really owns the account?


### Company Side


This system of "licensing access" to copies of digital items is not inherently an evil trick made by media services. It's only practical.  

The downside of licenses, is that the flexibility of them inherently comes with complications. 

Services that compile IP from multiple sources (like game sellers, movie susbcriptions, music subscription services, etc.) have to deal with a lot of moving parts. What happens if a deal made to the streaming service is broken? What if, suddenly, one creator demands that their work be taken out of your service?  

Of course, not all media is removed because of those cases. Perhaps the media service doesn't want to pay for something that they're making a loss on. After all, services struggle to prove they're making a profit in the first place.[^4]

After all, it is their service. The consumer can either agree or disagree with the terms set upon signing up for a subscription. 


### Consumer Side


On the other hand, consumers are frustrated. 

Before *home video* had ever been a thing, preserving movies and films had never been a priority. About 75% of films before 1929 are gone forever.[^5]

With the way it's becoming so difficult to consistently get access to movies that they love, consumers worry about another age of missing media. With the death of physical DVDs and the influence of streaming services, consumers worry about streaming services dropping the ball on archiving media.

It's not to mention the frustration of consumers suddenly losing the media they signed up to a particular service for in the first place. When media suddenly jumps around from one service to another, it's more hassle than it's worth to cancel one subscription and move to the other. And it's not exactly reasonable to expect consumers to pay for multiple subscriptions, especially when they all have the same problem.
