So what do we do about it?

It's easy to feel a little bleak when a software you like changes for the worse. From price hikes to shady ToS changes, we can't always anticipate when the next "update" will tarnish a product for you.

- Advocation for protecting consumer rights
- Boycotting products that exploit the userbase (including deletion of accounts)
- Finding alternative software to impliment, even when it's difficult

I hold the belief that if something is wrong, be annoying about it. Don't shut up about it. Bring it up on social media, who is gonna stop you? Being obnoxious gets people to listen.
