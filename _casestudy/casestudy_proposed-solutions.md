So what do we do about it? 

It's easy to feel a little bleak when a software you like changes for the worse. From price hikes to shady ToS changes, we can't always anticipate when the next "update" will tarnish a product for you.  

But with how diverse law can be in each area of world, it can be difficult to know where to begin. And with how *slow* the legal system works? Forcing these conversations in court can be a grueling process. 

But I hold the belief that if something is wrong, be annoying about it. Don't shut up about it. Bring it up on social media, who is gonna stop you? Being obnoxious gets people to listen. So make demands. I'll start:


## Transparency


A source for frustration for many is that they feel blindsided. Reading through pages and pages of leagalese for every Terms of Service contract you sign is a simply unrealistic expectation placed upon consumers. 

We should demand clarity from how businesses are run. We should be able to get the facts before a clause buried in text suddenly springs up out of nowhere. 

We just want assurance that our money isn't just getting thrown out a window when we commit to buying something for a *year.* 


## Summary


I'm not expecting a sudden *wave* of people to start arguing in court and filing lawsuits against the companies that exploit their end of the licensing agreement. But what I *do* think is important, is to be aware of this unclarity. 

My goal is to educate people about this problem, and how people are reacting to it. At the end of the day, it's not just *you* being annoyed at Hulu for removing another TV show you like. We should expect more from these services. 

Thanks for reading through.
