This is about licenses/websites that propose a service & subscription, but can totally upgrade their TOS to something that YOU didn't pay for.


## Adobe's Power Trip

Adobe’s backlash with AI having full access to “view” and “scan” the work made with their software. Only after backlash did they “clarify” what the purpose of these scans would be for. Specifically, Adobe emphasized that they only wanted access for their AI to scan for potentially abusive or illegal content (abuse material, sexual content regarding children, etc.) in order to comply with the law. 

A few notes that I feel are important to point out in [“Adobe’s clarification blog”](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2024/06/06/clarification-adobe-terms-of-use):

- Only a few changes to the text itself were made.
- The content in the new policy itself didn't change much.
- Adobe also mentioned in their [“FAQ”](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/machine-learning-faq.html) that their AI model does not train on user works unless you voluntarily contribute it. 


This initial controversy raised a lot of questions with the software’s user base. Especially to those already feeling frustration towards Adobe’s business practices. And although Adobe had issued corrections that placated (some) concerned users, I find that this situation has many ethical questions we can take from it and consider:


### Cancellation Fees

Adobe charges a [“cancellation fee”](https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/creative-cloud-subscription-terms.html) for users ending their subscriptions early, causing another layer of complication to any concerning policy changes. 


- Is it ethical to force users to agree with future policy and privacy changes upon paying for a subscription? Should they offer a window upon policy changes? On updates?


### Industry Standards

Adobe is considered the “industry standard” for any job or business that utilize any of the software it offers. Proficiency in Adobe’s software is even listed a prerequisite for many job opportunities on the market. But it’s pricing models and turn to AI is something that many consumers have seen as a boiling point in their patience with the company.  



## Image Generation vs. Artists

DeviantArt DreamUp / Twitter (X)’s Grok Image Generator - Should people have to opt-out of these sorts of things? Is it ethical for companies to scrape data already posted by its users before agreeing to terms? There's a clear weigh in favor of companies.
