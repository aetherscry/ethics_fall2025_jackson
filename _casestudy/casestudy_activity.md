Activity Time (sorta)

I didn't quite have the time to figure out how to code the thing I wanted to do to illustrate my point.

What I do have is a video simulation to somewhat represent what I wanted.

## Discussion Questions


Here are a few things to keep in mind throughout watching:


- How might subtle changes to user interfaces be hard to detect in applications that you use? How might you realize they're there?

- Do you think all changes made to interfaces you use have been helpful? (Think Instagram, YouTube, editing software, etc.)

- Clip Studio Paint, for example, allows users to fully customize the interface they use when illustrating. Do you think customizable interfaces could be applied to other software you use? (Social media, internet browsers, messaging platforms, etc.) Why or why not?

- Do you notice any hesitation or confusion when looking for tools between each adjustment? (This may be difficult, as the video is in 5x speed. Sorry.)

- Have you ever had any frustrating experiences with software interfaces before? What had been frustrating about it? Did you experience the frustration when you first started using the software, or did you experience it after an update?

## Dream Idea:

I initally wanted to have a small MS-paint or notebook-like program:
- The buttons will randomly change/turn off
- The user interface will randomly switch around
- The entire process sucks and it’s the entire point
