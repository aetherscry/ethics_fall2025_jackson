This will be where the activity will go

## General Idea:

I want to have a small MS-paint or notebook-like program:
- The buttons will randomly change/turn off
- The user interface will randomly switch around
- The entire process sucks and it’s the entire point

Alternate idea because I'm afraid I won't have enough time to actually go through with remaking MS paint
- Make a video of drawing something in clip studio
- Randomly change the format/brush 
- Pose questions through watching the video
