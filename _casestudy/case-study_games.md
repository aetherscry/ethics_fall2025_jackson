## Background

If you decided to click on this, you probably know a little bit about digital video game ownership. But as an overview, I'd like to talk about what "digital game ownership" actually is.

Unlike purchasing a physical cartridge to slip into your video game consoles, users have been given an option to purchase video games online. There are a ton of easy-to-use digital stores, depending on the video game console or device you are using. 

A few examples:
- Nintendo eShop (Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, previously on Wii, WiiU, 3DS, etc.)
- Playstation Store (Playstation devices)
- Microsoft Store (Windows/PC, Xbox)
- Steam (PC, Steam Deck)

But purchasing a video game is a little different than a physical copy. Instead of purchasing the "thing you put into the device," you are instead granted access to downloading a copy of the game over the internet. 

This is an important disctinction. You can't simply hand pass around a digital copy of a game, like you might let a friend borrow a book. Generally, you are given a **license to use** the the software when purchasing a game online. 

Simply, think of it as a way for companies to avoid consumers illegally reproducing their game: if a user can create infinite copies after purchasing ownership to a game, that would be detrimental to the market.

So instead, what you purchase when "buying a digital copy of a game," you are not given ownership, rather a license. These licenses are typically granted to the account you had made the purchase on. And there are terms that can be set by the seller to influence what can be done with that download. This also implies the potential right to the seller to revoke the license, therefore leaving you unable to buy the game you had purchased. Additionally, they are able to modify the Terms of Service and updates to the game as they see fit.

## What is "Stop Killing Games?"

“Stop Killing Games:”
	> <q>‘Stop Killing Games’ is a consumer movement started to challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers. An increasing number of video games are sold effectively as goods - with no stated expiration date - but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends. This practice is a form of planned obsolescence and is not only detrimental to customers, but makes preservation effectively impossible.</q> &8211;Stop Killing Games Website
Stop Killing Games is a movement that started in April 2024 by a YouTuber named [Ross Scott (also known as Accursed Farms)](https://www.youtube.com/@Accursed_Farms). Scott had launched this campaign and official [website](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/) in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE) on his YouTube page on April 2nd, 2024. Scott has been openly critical of the way that video game publishers have poorly treated and shut down their IP, his critiques dating as early as 2013 in a [game review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68zZZn8wy4E) about the game [*Test Drive 3*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Drive_III:_The_Passion). 


> <q>It pisses me off to no end when a company simply sits on intellectual property, and lets games they don’t even care about die.</q> &#8211;Ross Scott, 10/27/13


The movement launched to rally opposition to the game industry’s recurring practice of shutting down their game servers for their consumers. The movement has called for consumers to sign petitions to consumer rights protection regulators across the globe for change. The basis of these arguments is that–despite what game publishes may call them–video games are “goods,” not “services.” They should not become inoperable after being purchased. Scott advocates for game publishers to have contingency plans after games end service. 


There are methods of defense these publishers may take in response. For example, Steam’s (a digital distribution service) [Subscriber Agreement](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement) specifically uses the language that the games sold are **licenses**: something with the capacity to be revoked. 


Regardless of legal outcomes in each country the movement is being discussed in, there are many questions and arguments that have been raised throughout this case.

## Servers | City of Heroes & Club Penguin Rewritten
A big point of discussion in the movement is about what to do when companies no longer want to host game servers. 


Scott doesn’t believe that game developers need to continue support server life infinitely by themselves, he proposes to find a compromise in this regard. For example, fans had secretly kept alive a [*City of Heroes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Heroes) server online after the popular MMO had been shut down by NCsoft. After the server’s existence was leaked to the public, NCsoft had opted to give the fans an official license to keep the IP alive. Of course, other projects have not had such luck, such as [*Club Penguin Rewritten*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Penguin_Rewritten), a fan server of the original [*Club Penguin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Penguin) owned by Disney. This project was shut down in 2022 by Disney, the website had been taken over by the City of London Police, and three suspects were arrested (and later released). 

### Developer Side


Game developers have very mixed reactions to fans taking over the servers of the games they have created. Disney, in particular, has a reputation for being very defensive of their IP and how it’s portrayed. There’s a lot of hesitancy for game developers to hand over the reputation of their game to a fandom.  
Relinquishing control can raise some concerns for the developers that they would rather move on from.
Ex. Child safety concerns — if an MMO was mostly targeted towards children, should they really trust the fan base to ensure the safety of those children without having the original moderators?
How do you select who in the community to give a license to host servers to? What if you select poorly?
If a game is poorly managed by fan bases, the company has the potential to take the hit for it via reputational damage. 


### Consumer Side


On the other hand, though, letting games be shut down is an indication that they no longer want anything to do with the IP. Personally speaking, I believe that there are far more benefits to handing over permission to willing fans to continue running games that have died. 
There is (under the assumption that cosmetics or other items are not sold for real currency), no loss to profits. Companies would no longer have to pay for servers. They simply retain the community they have gathered for the game they have shut down. 
Companies could theoretically revoke these licenses down the line if the way their game is being maintained is mismanaged. This allows companies to maintain the control they want on their IP. 
Consumers can (and likely will) still run private servers, they just have to be sneakier about it. 
This gives companies less visibility to see what is being done to the legacy of their game. 
This is similar to arguments around piracy.


When consumers sign up for these games in the first place, they are never given the expiration date. So, is it fair to accept when discontinuation happens and move on to something else? Should it become common practice for companies to allow players themselves to take-on the support for their game?

## Refunds | The Crew


As previously stated, Ross Scott had been openly critical of the way that publishers “kill” their games. The game that seems to have pushed Scott towards finally launching this campaign was the shutdown of the game [*The Crew*](https://thecrew.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crew) by Ubisoft. In a [video response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIqyvquTEVU) to this game’s shutdown, Ross began to pose his ideas to take tangible legal action. *Stop Killing Games* had launched only a few months after this video had been published.


In Ubisoft’s initial announcement of the shutting down of servers, the company had allegedly* <sub>(see Note)</sub> stated players may apply for a refund if they had purchased the game “recently.” The definition of the word “recent” had been quite vague, leaving it up to whichever platform the game was purchased from.


> Note: As of writing, I cannot find a functional link to Ubisoft’s original statement. The statement about refunds is based on secondhand writing from [Chalk’s PC Gamer article](https://www.pcgamer.com/the-crew-removed-from-sale-will-become-unplayable-after-april-1-we-understand-this-may-be-disappointing-for-players-still-enjoying-the-game/).


This brings up another aspect to consider when thinking about the consumers have when purchasing digital games. If a game ends service, should compensation be dispersed if the copy is now obsolete? 


### Company Side


Giving out refunds for shut-down games sounds completely unrealistic on its face. After all, the consumer had purchased the license for the product, and were also delivered the product under the knowledge that online services are likely to end at some point. There is much room for reasonable doubt on the feasibility of refunds:   
Where is this money meant to be pulled from? The profits of the game may be already spend on developer paychecks or future projects. 
How much are people being refunded?
Should players who have had the game for a long time get refunded? How do you determine who had gotten their money’s worth?
What are the refund policies of the distributors of your game? Is there even a system for refunds?
How can you verify if an individual had even purchased the game in the first place?


These are merely a few of the logistical questions that may come up immediately. 


### Consumer Side


If you had just purchased a game, and it’s immediately shut down, that can cause a lot of frustration. But, this is a rare instance. And there are other reasons people may argue for the case of refunds:


Ross Scott, for example, argues that video games are not services, they are goods. If they take away the good you paid for, why can’t you take your money back?
Consumers were not given an expiration date for the game they were purchasing. What if they’re still playing, or still want to down the line? Are they meant to cut the loss of value they didn’t get from their purchase?


Refunds are a complicated topic for the sheer variety of games on the market, and the variety of games that are shut down. Personally, I don’t see refunds being the solution for consumer rights in video games. It’s something that I see companies pushing back against, and something that’s difficult to find a reaspnable middle ground on.
