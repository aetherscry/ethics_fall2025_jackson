## What is "Stop Killing Games?"

“Stop Killing Games:”
	> <q>‘Stop Killing Games’ is a consumer movement started to challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers. An increasing number of video games are sold effectively as goods - with no stated expiration date - but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends. This practice is a form of planned obsolescence and is not only detrimental to customers, but makes preservation effectively impossible.</q> &8211;Stop Killing Games Website
Stop Killing Games is a movement that started in April 2024 by a YouTuber named [Ross Scott (also known as Accursed Farms)](https://www.youtube.com/@Accursed_Farms). Scott had launched this campaign and official [website](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/) in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w70Xc9CStoE) on his YouTube page on April 2nd, 2024. Scott has been openly critical of the way that video game publishers have poorly treated and shut down their IP, his critiques dating as early as 2013 in a [game review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68zZZn8wy4E) about the game [*Test Drive 3*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Drive_III:_The_Passion). 


> <q>It pisses me off to no end when a company simply sits on intellectual property, and lets games they don’t even care about die.</q> &#8211;Ross Scott, 10/27/13


The movement launched to rally opposition to the game industry’s recurring practice of shutting down their game servers for their consumers. The movement has called for consumers to sign petitions to consumer rights protection regulators across the globe for change. The basis of these arguments is that–despite what game publishes may call them–video games are “goods,” not “services.” They should not become inoperable after being purchased. 


There are methods of defense these publishers may take in response. For example, Steam’s (a digital distribution service) [Subscriber Agreement](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement) specifically uses the language that the games sold are **licenses**: something with the capacity to be revoked. 


Regardless of legal outcomes in each country the movement is being discussed in, there are many questions and arguments that have been raised throughout this case.


#### Servers | City of Heroes & Club Penguin Rewritten

A big point of discussion in the movement is about what to do when companies no longer want to host game servers. 


Scott doesn’t believe that game developers need to continue support server life infinitely by themselves, he proposes to find a compromise in this regard. For example, fans had secretly kept alive a [*City of Heroes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Heroes) server online after the popular MMO had been shut down by NCsoft. After the server’s existence was leaked to the public, NCsoft had opted to give the fans an official license to keep the IP alive. Of course, other projects have not had such luck, such as [*Club Penguin Rewritten*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Penguin_Rewritten), a fan server of the original [*Club Penguin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Penguin) owned by Disney. This project was shut down in 2022 by Disney, the website had been taken over by the City of London Police, and three suspects were arrested (and later released). 


Game developers have very mixed reactions to fans taking over the servers of the games they have created. Disney, in particular, has a reputation for being very defensive of their IP and how it’s portrayed. There’s a lot of hesitancy for game developers to hand over the reputation of their game to a fandom.  


On the other hand, though, letting games be shut down is an indication that they no longer want anything to do with the IP. Personally speaking, I believe that there are far more benefits to handing over permission to willing fans to continue running games that have died. 
There is (under the assumption that cosmetics or other items are not sold for real currency), no loss to profits. Companies would no longer have to pay for servers. They simply retain the community they have gathered for the game they have shut down. 
Companies could theoretically revoke these licenses down the line if the way their game is being maintained is mismanaged. This allows companies to maintain the control they want on their IP. 
Consumers can (and likely will) still run private servers, they just have to be sneakier about it. 
This gives companies less visibility to see what is being done to the legacy of their game. 
This is similar to arguments around piracy.
