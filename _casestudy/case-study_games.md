## What is "Stop Killing Games?"

Background of the movement.

## Company Side

- Game servers aren't cheap
- If nobody is playing a co-op game, should they keep paying for the server?
- Potential year availability minimum upon launching game servers


## Consumer Side

You bought a game, but can no longer play it. What now??
- Putting money into cosmetics
- I can probably mention the Counter Strike stock market crash incident
