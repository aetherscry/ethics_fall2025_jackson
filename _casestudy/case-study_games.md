## What is "Stop Killing Games?"

According to it’s [official website](https://www.stopkillinggames.com/): “Stop Killing Games" is a consumer movement started to challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers. An increasing number of video games are sold effectively as goods - with no stated expiration date - but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends. This practice is a form of planned obsolescence and is not only detrimental to customers, but makes preservation effectively impossible.”

Stop Killing Games is a movement that began in April 2024. The campaign was launched by a YouTuber named Ross Scott, who introduced the campaign and it's website in a video. Stop Killing Games was born from a history of outrage towards video game publishers shutting down their games’ support and servers, effectively making the consumer’s copy of those games obsolete. This sparked a debate about the legality of the practice, and what rights consumers actually should have.


## Company Side

- Game servers aren't cheap
- If nobody is playing a co-op game, should they keep paying for the server?
- Potential year availability minimum upon launching game servers


## Consumer Side

You bought a game, but can no longer play it. What now??
- Putting money into cosmetics
- I can probably mention the Counter Strike stock market crash incident
