# Digital "Ownership" and Terms of Service

Do you really own digital copies of games or software? (No, not really.)

We'll be talking about gaming, ToS, Adobe's greed, and more.

## Overview | "DJ, what are you talking about?"

Digital licenses are something almost all of us deal with. From buying a video game off Steam, to buying a Adobe Photoshop subscription.

But do we really *own* the things we purchase? Do we get any say in our copies or licenses upon purchase? What does it even mean to have a license?

This case study goes over a few areas of digital "ownership," and discusses the conversations we can have about the ethics around them.
