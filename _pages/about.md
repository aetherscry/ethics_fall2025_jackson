This page is meant for you to showcase your case study, podcasts, and blog posts reflecting on our readings. You will need to update the content in each section and submit your site to Moodle (see calendar). Once all sections are updated, revise this paragraph so it summarizes the purpose of your site for new visitors. This can include how to navigate it, what each section contains, and what someone should understand about your work just by reading this introduction.

Hello! This website exists to document my learning in my CSCI course! This page has some general information about me. You can use the tabs located at the top of this page to navigate to other parts of the website. They'll be updated as I go!

About Me
---
My name is Damien Jackson. Iâ€™m a Computer Science student in the [Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Department](https://wp.stolaf.edu/mscs/) at St. Olaf College. Additionally, I'm working towards a Concentration in the [Education](https://wp.stolaf.edu/education/) department! I'm earning my B.S in Computer Science. 

Research

I have an interest in robotics, it's something I've found to be fascinating since I was young. I don't have much hands-on experience with it, but I would love to learn more about it!

Personal Life
---
I really love art and hands-on hobbies. I am a freelance digital artist and character designer in my free time. Additionally, I play a ton of video games. I feel like they intersect with Computer Science in some ways, but maybe I'm just biased!
