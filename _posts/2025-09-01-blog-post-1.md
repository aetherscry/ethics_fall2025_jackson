This article covers X (formerly Twitter)'s AI Grok, and Elon Musk boasting about it's improved model following an update. This article covers the "update"'s new, odd behavior, and the type of information this AI started spreading across the platform. 

Q1. Why did you choose this article?
A1. Last year, I was taking a course where we could write just about anything we wanted as long as it could relate back to the course (Money & Magic). I had decided to make my essay on Elon Musk and the "fetish" of Billionaires in America. This essay started up just after the announcement of D.O.G.E, and the following chaos that the first month in office had brought. I did a lot of research about how he changed Twitter, and how dangerous his control over the platform could be. So when I saw this article, I figured it would tie in to a lot of the things I had to say when writing. 

Q2. What are some main points of Ethical Concerns in this article?

Q3. Identify stakeholder identification, role, and concerns:
A3. Here is what I could identify:
Stakeholder: Users of the website
Role or Context: Use Twitter/X's AI to answer questions, or to use it to help understand posts made on the website. 
Ethical Concern: Potentially recieving and promoting false information that had been compiled by an AI on social media.

Stakeholder: Elon Musk
Role or Context: Twitter/X CEO, Affiliate of the Republican Party in the U.S., Self-proclaimed "attack dog" for Donald Trump.  
Ethical Concern: Using AI to push a political agenda to a massive crowd. Spreading false information and conspiracy theories though an easily accessible AI.

Q4: Discuss a few ethical frameworks and how they align or conflict with the article. Add brief reasoning to your stance.
A4. 
Utilitarianism: 
Right Action: Creating a method of delivering brief, accurate information upon request. 
Wrong Action: Spreading traditionally antisemitic and transphobic rhetoric through a public platformn. Generally posting conspiracies or misinformation about marginalized communities to push an ideology. 

Contractarianism:
Right Action: Fairness would entail unbiased, factual information to be delivered consistently. 
Wrong Action: A heavy bias towards one group over the other, as well as censoring information that doesn't agree with certain worldviews. 

Q5: Reflect how the exercise went for you.
A5: The exercise went alright for me! I'm writing this while pretty sick, so I'm just hoping that my thoughts were clear enough. I thought the article was an interesting read!
