Discussion Questions
---
This article discusses what data-driven rules are, and how they're potentially harmful. In particular, the study places an emphasis on the "exceptions" who are unfairly harmed by data-driven rules. 

Q1: What is a data-driven rule, and what does it mean to be a data-driven exception? Is an exception the same as an error?

A1: A data-driven rule is an algorithm made to make decisions based on the average answers it is given. Essentially, it is something made to save time by making judgements based on previous information. Exceptions are outliers to the "average answers" the data-driven rule is given. They fall through the cracks of the system, and become left behind. An exception isn't the same as an error: they still qualify, yet they are still denied by the algorithm based on incorrect judgement.

Q2: In addition to those listed above, what other factors differentiate data-driven decisions from human ones?

A2: Data-driven decisions struggle to account for nuance. Humans may be able to determine nuance based on experience and outside factors, but a machine is incapable of that level of judgement.  

Q3: Beyond what is discussed above, what are some of the benefits and downsides of individualization?

A3: In an ideal world, individualism would allow for algorithms to make judgements with perfect accuracy. On the other hand, it may lead to some major privacy concerns for the user.

Q4: Why is uncertainty so critical to the right to be an exception? When the stakes are high (e.g., in criminal sentencing), is there any evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy) that can justify the use of a data-driven rule without the consideration of uncertainty?

A4: Uncertainty allows space for nuance. Its one way to prevent making hasty, life-changing decisions where the outcome is hard to determine. It allows you to understand that there isn't enough knowledge to predict an outcome immediately. 

I introduce a new discussion question along with the ones provided: Do you think it's possible for a data-driven algorithm to be perfect? Especially considering human-error will always be a factor already. Can a perfect data-driven rule be created in that case?
