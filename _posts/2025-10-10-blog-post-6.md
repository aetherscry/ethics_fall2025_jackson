E-waste and why it's depressing.

**Case Study:**  
["From Mining to E-waste: The Environmental and Climate Justice Implications of the Electronics Hardware Life Cycle"](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/w9ht6hue/release/5?readingCollection=ca73f7c0)

This article goes over the consequences of hardware's life cycle. In particular, it talks about e-waste's relationship with climate change, and discusses the implications of it's sustainability. 

The article itself frames a few questions for discussion. I will be taking the time to answer 5 of time with my own thoughts. 

First, the article asks about the relation between mining for economic development vs. climate justice, and the balance between them. In particular, the question asks if it's possible for these two areas to co-exist. Now, in my perspective, I am not optimistic that they can co-exist. CEOs trying to make money don't exactly seem to care about what happens to the planet after they're long dead. They won't exactly be alive to deal with the conseqences of their actions. Climate Change inititives *do* actually care about what happens to the world, which unfortunately isn't profitable. Companies want access to as many resources as possible to stay ahead of the game, we've seen this time and time again. Until Elon Musk starts donating even a mere decimal of his wealth, I don't see a world where the earth will take priority on both sides.  

Second, the article asks about mining again. Specifically that green technology requires resources to make them. Is the tradeoff of climate mitigation worth the cost to the local communities and environments that are impacted by it? And again, I have a very pessimistic view about this, honestly. I feel like even if green energy didn't take those resources, it would only be a matter of time before some other corporation manages to snag the rights to mine there anyway. I'd rather the resources go towards something that can *also* fix some of the problems they're causing, instead of letting some apathetic person leave a crater there. 

The third question references LCAs and asks what products or technologies I would like to see an LCA for. I would love to see a full LCA on a lot of solar panel companies I've seen pop up. I don't know a lot about how those are made, but I'm actually curious if they require a lot of energy to manufacture. I'd also like to know more about windmills (shoutout Big Ole), I don't know how many resources those take to build. 

The fourth question asks about challenges to proposed solutions to the e-waste problem. And I think this ties back to the age-old money & convenience conundrum, honestly. We would have fixed it by now if companies really wanted, but they don't. That's because it costs a lot of money to properly dispose of these things. It's super depressing, but theres almost no shot a company would willingly pay to dispose of something if theres a far cheaper alternative. If the only cheap alternative is mass-waste, then so be it.  

Next the article asks for us to connect how the climate justice implicatios of e-waste interact with social issues in the Global South, like exploitation, dangerous work, lax environmental regulation, etc. And I hate that I don't have another answer, but I think it goes back to money *again*. It's cheaper to exploit the world around you than it is to pay employees. Forcing other people in poorer countries is something that has become so normalized in the history of colonization and slavery that it's become an expectation. Theres almost a disregard that people in the Global South are human too, theres just so much apathy for other people's lives when you don't have to interact with them.  

I would like to propose an additional question. Considering a lot of my discussions revolved around money, I'd like to ask something that relates to it: "Do you think it would be realistic to force companies to pay strict fees for the emissions they produce? Do you think it would work, and how would you try to regulate it? Why would/wouldn't this work? 

I personally don't see this working logistically, mostly because those who have the power to shape this sort of thing are also stakeholders in the exploitation. Those who are rich got their money somehow, and they have a particular interest in not losing their money. But maybe I'm wrong. I certainly hope I am.

In reflection, I do truly believe those who gain financial power by exploiting the earth should just suck it up and use some of their boundless wealth to fix the problems *they* caused. Do I see this happening? Absolutely not. It's forced into the hands of people who already suffer under the canyon-like wealth gap in America and other countries. It's really depressing!
